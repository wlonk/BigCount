BigCount
========

This is a fork of
<https://github.com/vanillaforums/Addons/tree/master/plugins/Voting>, removing
all the voting code and just leaving the big counts of Follows, Views,
Comments.

Like Voting, it requires the Statistics plugin to be activated and configured
to accurately track Views. The Statistics plugin requires PHP to be able to use
`curl`.

This plugin is incompatible with Voting, because it provides a subset of the
features of Voting. If you need votes, deactivate this, and activate Voting!
